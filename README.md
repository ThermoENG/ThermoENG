Hello,

I am a beginner level programmer in Python and C#. My expertise lies in refrigeration as a mechanical engineer and I have developed internal tools for companies I have
worked at in the past, however I am interested in getting involved with the Github community in opensource projects. My hobby in programming is using C# in game development
(true beginner in this space).

Please feel free to reach out to me through my email listed above on projects that you need assistance on in engineering topics (thermo, fluid mechanics, etc.) or in game
development.
